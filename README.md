# Women-Diabetes-Detector
A dockerized end to end ML Web app for web app for detection of diabetes among women with a high classification accuracy.

# Features
1. Various plots to get detailed information about how different algortihms classify thereby affecting a diabetes diagnosis.

# Link for web app:
http://whispering-everglades-97562.herokuapp.com/

Note - The app takes time to load for first time.

# Running code locally:
1. Git clone the repository 
2. Open CMD, navigate to cloned directory and run "pip install -r requirements.txt" This will install all the dependencies including Streamlit.
3. In the project directory open a command prompt and enter "streamlit run app.py" This will start Streamlit locally.

# Project History
I had already made this project for practice in a jupyter notebook but wanted to learn how to deploy ML models so that anyone can use them hence I decided to revisit the project and make a full fledged web app using streamlit. I then deployed a docker container of the webapp on Heroku
